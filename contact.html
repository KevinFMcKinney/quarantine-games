				<h3>Kevin McKinney</h3>
				<p>My first gaming experience was when I was a child playing Pokemon Emerald on my GameBoy Advance. Ever since I been a very big fan of playing video games, especially on Nintendo consoles. I transitioned from my GameBoy to a Nintendo DS and also loved playing the Wii with my family and friends. Eventually I built a PC to take my love for playing games to a higher level. Currently I play games on my PC and Nintendo Switch (and occasionally Wii). Games I'm currently playing are Animal Crossing, Mario Tennis Aces, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and FIFA 21.</p>

				<p>I'm a big fan of video games. I've always been into the Rougue-like genre since there's a bunch of endless fun and really cool runs that can happen. I've also always had a soft spot for chill farming simulator games like Stardew Valley.</p>
